# automation

Scripts for @freeCodeCamp's GitHub automation tasks.

## Usage

Todo

## Caveat 

The automation scripts will error out on actions performed by repository admins, for example:

> If an admin removes a label from a Pull request, the script can not add that label back. This is usually because the script is acting on behalf of a non-admin user with write access.
>
> This is usually the case with the use of access tokens for scripts.
